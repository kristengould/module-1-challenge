# <Module-1-challenge>

## Description

The purpose of this project is to refactor a website's code to include semantic HTML elements and consolidate elements in the CSS file. This makes for a cleaner looking code, and provides search engine optimization and alt text for users with sight limitations. Throughout this project I have practiced my skills with HTML and CSS, and gained extra experience with Githib.
